                    <p>This is where it all began; the first album put out by the band themselves! <i>Thrill Of The Feel</i> is comprised of all the songs recorded by a full band in the video game EA Sports NASCAR Arcade.</p>
                    <p>This album is essentially a soundtrack for the video game - however, it only contains the songs with a full band performance, not everything Jun produced.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, five of the songs on this album do not have any vocals, making this album the only one released by the band to feature instrumental tracks.</p>
                    <p>This album also includes the song "Open Your Heart" from <i>Sonic Adventure</i> as a bonus track, which was created two years prior to this album's release, and was the only other "Crush 40" song at the time.</p>
                    <p>In addition, this release is the only one to use the band's former title, "Sons of Angels" (named after the song from 1997's "Daytona USA Chamionship Circuit Edition", by Jun Senoue, featuring Eric Martin on vocals), as this would soon be changed in the album "Crush 40".</p>

                    <p>This album marks the first time the name "Crush 40" was used. Before this album the band was known as "Sons Of Angels", and they didn't go by any specific name in "Sonic Adventure" and "Sonic Adventure 2" (Just crediting the individual performers). 
                    <p>In theory, this album is just a western release of the Thrill Of The Feel album, but there's a little more to it. All of the vocal tracks from Thrill Of The Feel are included on this release, including Open Your Heart, which was a bonus track on Thrill Of The Feel. However, the instrumental tracks were not carried over from Thrill Of The Feel, and instead 3 other songs from the Sonic Adventure games were included.
                    <p>Live & Learn, from "Sonic Adventure 2" was included as the first track, and two bonus tracks were added: It Doesn't Matter (by Jun Senoue, featuring Tony Harnell on vocals), from "Sonic Adventure", and Escape From The City (by Jun Senoue, featuring Ted Poley & Tony Harnell on vocals), from "Sonic Adventure 2".</p>
                    <p>The order of the setlist was drastically changed from Thrill Of The Feel, with only "Into The Wind" remaining in the same position. "Revvin' Up", "Into The Wind" and "All The Way" also have slightly longer/shorter playing lengths (by one second) between the two albums. Open Your Heart is also 5 seconds longer on this album.</p>
                    <p>The name "Crush 40" would be carried over to the game "Sonic Heroes", which would be released later in 2003.</p>

                    <p>Rise Again is a compilation of the four singles released by Crush 40 throughout 2011 and 2012: "Song of Hope", "Sonic Youth", "One Of Those Days", "Rise Again".</p>
                    <p>The singles are featured on this EP in the order they were released - with "Song of Hope" being the first to "Rise Again" being the last to be released.</p>
                    <p>There was a variant of this CD created for Sonic Boom 2012, unofficially known as the <i>Sonic Boom 2012 Promotional EP</i>. This release is the same as the full EP, but excludes the 2011 single "Song of Hope", instead opting to only include the other three singles, released in 2012.</p>
