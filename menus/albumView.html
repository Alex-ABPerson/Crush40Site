                    <p>This is where it all began; the first album put out by the band themselves! <i>Thrill Of The Feel</i> is comprised of all the songs recorded by a full band in the video game EA Sports NASCAR Arcade.</p>
                    <p>This album is essentially a soundtrack for the video game - however, it only contains the songs with a full band performance, not everything Jun produced.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, five of the songs on this album do not have any vocals, making this album the only one released by the band to feature instrumental tracks.</p>
                    <p>This album also includes the song "Open Your Heart" from <i>Sonic Adventure</i> as a bonus track, which was created two years prior to this album's release, and was the only other "Crush 40" song at the time.</p>
                    <p>In addition, this release is the only one to use the band's former title, "Sons of Angels" (named after the song from 1997's "Daytona USA Chamionship Circuit Edition", by Jun Senoue, featuring Eric Martin on vocals), as this would soon be changed in the album "Crush 40".</p>

                    <p>This album marks the first time the name "Crush 40" was used. Before this album the band was known as "Sons Of Angels", and they didn't go by any specific name in "Sonic Adventure" and "Sonic Adventure 2" (Just crediting the individual performers). 
                    <p>In theory, this album is just a western release of the Thrill Of The Feel album, but there's a little more to it. All of the vocal tracks from Thrill Of The Feel are included on this release, including Open Your Heart, which was a bonus track on Thrill Of The Feel. However, the instrumental tracks were not carried over from Thrill Of The Feel, and instead 3 other songs from the Sonic Adventure games were included.
                    <p>Live & Learn, from "Sonic Adventure 2" was included as the first track, and two bonus tracks were added: It Doesn't Matter (by Jun Senoue, featuring Tony Harnell on vocals), from "Sonic Adventure", and Escape From The City (by Jun Senoue, featuring Ted Poley & Tony Harnell on vocals), from "Sonic Adventure 2".</p>
                    <p>The order of the setlist was drastically changed from Thrill Of The Feel, with only "Into The Wind" remaining in the same position. "Revvin' Up", "Into The Wind" and "All The Way" also have slightly longer/shorter playing lengths (by one second) between the two albums. Open Your Heart is also 5 seconds longer on this album.</p>
                    <p>The name "Crush 40" would be carried over to the game "Sonic Heroes", which would be released later in 2003.</p>

                    <p>2 Nights 2 Remember is unique in that it is both a studio EP and a live album. The first four tracks on the album are brand-new studio songs created specifically for the EP, while the rest of the album features professionally-recorded audio of their 2 Nights 2 Remember live performance, with their inclusion allowing the length of this album to be closer to others.</p>
                    <p>The four new tracks: 2 Nights 2 Remember, Big Mouth, Light of the Day and Down & Dirty had been previously released in short versions, but this was their first proper release, and their intended final placement too. 2 Nights 2 Remember and Down & Dirty were both selected to be included in the live concert segment of the CD too.</p>
                    <p>The 2 Nights 2 Remember live performances were at Live Stage Guilty, on March 29th 2014 and March 30th 2014. Once again, both shows were professionally recorded and put on the CD in exactly the same manner as Live!.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, a significant amount of the concert was excluded from this release and all subsequent digital releases, as this was only really included to pad the remainder of the CD space, which could only fit half the concert. See the dedicated show page for more info about the recording and release of this concert.</p>

                    <p>Driving Through Forever is Crush 40's most recent album. It is another compilation album in the vein of <i>Super Sonic Songs</i>, which aims to celebrate the past 20 years of Crush 40, containing tracks ranging from "Open Your Heart", written in 1998, to "Green Light Ride", written in 2018.</p>
                    <p><i>Driving Through Forever</i> contains a new mix of "His World" and a new song "Call Me Crazy", which had only ever been performed live before the album was released, at the Japan Game Music Festival II:RE.</p>
                    <p><b><u>Bonus DVD</u></b></p>
                    <p>The release also included a <b>bonus DVD</b>, which is a compilation DVD of various random clips - comprised of previous lyric videos and footage from live shows.</p>
                    <p>Most notably, the DVD includes half an hour of completely unseen footage from the 2014 2 Nights 2 Remember performance, even going as far to feature a song from the concert that <i>wasn't</i> featured on the 2 Nights 2 Remember CD, I Am... All Of Me. Find out more about the content featured on the 2 Nights 2 Remember show page.</p>
                    <p>In addition, this DVD contains one of the only known videos of the Crush 40's JGMF II:RE performance, as well as a previously unreleased multi-camera video of "Open Your Heart" from JGMF 2013.</p>
