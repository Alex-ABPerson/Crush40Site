            <p>The first known performance with him and Jun together is 2012, as part of a "Fiano" show, which was then shortly followed by Japan Game Music Festival (JGMF) one year later.</p>
            <p>He used to call himself "Act.", so some old tweets by Jun and the like still refer to him as that.</p>
