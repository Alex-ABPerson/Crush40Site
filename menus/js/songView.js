            <p>"What I'm Made Of..." is the second Crush 40 track on Sonic Heroes, and has been remarked multiple times by Johnny as his favourite Crush 40 song of all time. 
            <p>Jun had already created a short demo of "What I'm Made Of..." before the title track of the game, Sonic Heroes, was even composed, but it was initially rejected by the team.</p>
            <p>Insisting that the song be used in the game, late into development it was decided it would be used as the track for the final boss; Jun then informed Johnny about the track (who was in the middle of a camping trip with his family), and how it was needed to be written quickly.</p>
            <p>And so, inside of a tour bus' kitchen area, Johnny began writing the lyrics to the track, and by Summer 2003 an early demo featuring background vocals was completed. By Fall 2003, the track was completely finished.</p>

                        <p>For [the 2 Nights 2 Remember performance], I played "What I'm Made Of" with my "82" instead of my Sonic guitar for the first time - I just wanted to play my favourite song on that guitar!</p>

<p>I don't care what you're thinking<br/>
As you turn to me<br/>
Cause what I have in my two hands<br/>
Is enough to set me free<br/>
I could fight the feeling<br/>
To resist it over time<br/>
But when it's just too much to take<br/>
You sneak up from behind</p>
<p>Is it me, you say, you're looking for<br/>
Let me show you who I am and what I'm here for... here for...</p>
<p>Try to reach inside of me, try to drain my energy<br/>
Let me show you just what I'm made of<br/>
Simple curiosity tries to take a bite of me<br/>
Let me show you just what I'm made of now...</p>
<p>Like a million faces<br/>
I've recognized them all<br/>
And one by one they've all become<br/>
A black mark on the floor</p>
<p>Is it me, you say, you're looking for<br/>
Let me show you who I am and what I have in store.... in store...</p>
<p>Try to reach inside of me, try to drain my energy<br/>
Let me show you just what I'm made of<br/>
Simple curiosity tries to take a bite of me<br/>
Let me show you just what I'm made of now...</p>
<p>You can take another life long try<br/>
You can take another try...</p>
<p>Try to reach inside of me, try to drain my energy<br/>
Let me show you just what I'm made of<br/>
Simple curiosity tries to take a bite of me<br/>

<p>Take a look inside your heart<br />
What once seemed fair today<br />
Tomorrow it may not<br />
Just a walk or a journey<br />
Don't stop reaching high<br />
Don't let the time pass you by</p>
<p>So many ways that you can try to forget<br />
So many ways you'll find you wake up to regret</p>
<p>Someday, one day we'll say live life I know<br />
Hold on hold tight<br />
Don't let go don't lose sight</p>
<p>Feeling like the road<br />
Is winding you on every turn<br />
But there are lessons to learn<br />
Take a look inside your heart<br />
What once seemed impossible<br />
Today is not</p>
<p>So many ways that you can try to forget<br />
So many ways you'll find you wake up to regret</p>
<p>Someday, one day we'll say live life I know<br />

Don't let go don't lose sight<br />
Someday, one day we'll say live life I know<br />
Hold on hold tight<br />
Don't let go</p>
<p>I can't imagine I can't imagine<br />
Making it on your own<br />
You've got it inside you've got it inside of you...<br />
So let it out...!</p>
<p>Someday, one day we'll say live life I know<br />
Hold on hold tight<br />

            <p>"I Am... All Of Me" is the main theme of "Shadow The Hedgehog". Originally, Magna-fi (who also wrote & recorded "All Hail Shadow") had written a track called "Who I Am" to be the game's main theme, but was excluded due to complications with the band's then label, Aezra.</p>
            <p>The game itself goes for a radically different approach in comparison to previous games (taking inspiration from the then-emerging mature game market), so Jun followed suit with a soundtrack focusing on Heavy & Industrial Metal.</p> 
            <p>"I Am... All Of Me" stands out as the game & soundtrack's crowning achievement, being the first song the player hears during the opening cinematic, along with the final boss. Despite the game's polarizing reception, the track has become regarded as one of Crush 40's best, being a fan favorite & commonly performed during their live shows.</p>

            <p>Jun made at least 7 different demos of this track before settling on the final arrangement, multiple of which were made featuring different vocalists. The earliest available demo features co-composer <i>Kenichi Tokoi</i> on vocals, and the most famous of all is the demo featuring "Anthem" vocalist <i>Eizo Sakamoto</i>, which appears to have been recorded around Summer 1998.</p>
            <p>Eizo's demo would end up making it to prototypes of the game, and was also performed the track live during the "SONIC Adventure Production Presentation" on September 1998.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this demo, Jun contacted Johnny via Neal Schon of "Journey" to ask him to record for the track, as a result completing it around October 1998 and forming their relationship that would later give rise to "Crush 40".</p>

                        <p>For a long time, this song didn't have a guitar solo, but I put it in at the end on a whim, and the 'whin-whin-whin' guitar sound at the end of the song is an electric screwdriver being played on the guitar, if that makes sense.</p>
                        <p>We prepared a demo of this song sung by Tokoi for the <i>Sonic Adventure Presentation</i>, and another one sung by Sakamoto that actually ended up being used.</p>
                        <p>I guess we recorded a lot of things. Recording with Johnny Gioeli in the end was tough because of our tight schedule, but it was perfect!</p>

<p>Thunder, rain, and lightning<br />
Danger, water rising<br />
Clamour, sirens wailing<br />
It's such a bad sign</p>
<p>Shadows of dark creatures<br />
Steel clouds floating in the air<br />
People run for shelter<br />
What's gonna happen to us!?</p>
<p>All the steps we take, all the moves we make, all the pain at stake<br />
I see the chaos for everyone who are we what can we do<br />
You and I are the same in the way that we have our own styles that we won't change<br />
Yours is filled with evil and mine's not there is no way I can lose</p>
<p>Can't hold on much longer - But I will never let go<br />
I know it's a one-way track - Tell me now how long this'll last<br />
I'm not gonna think this way - Nor will I count on others<br />
Close my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do</p>
<p>Open your heart, it's gonna be alright</p>
<p>Ancient city blazing<br />
Shadows keep attacking<br />
Little children crying<br />
Confusion, hopeless anger</p>
<p>I don't know what it can be but you drive me crazy<br />
All your cunning tricks make me sick, you won't have it your own way</p>
<p>Can't hold on much longer - But I will never let go<br />
I know it's a one-way track - Tell me now how long this'll last<br />

Its heart is tied down by all the hate, gotta set him free</p>

            <p>The first Crush 40 song to be played in D Standard tuning, Knight of The Wind was written as the opening track for 2009's <i>Sonic and The Black Knight</i>. The song has been a fan favourite since, with over 5 million plays on Spotify, and it's easy to see why!</p> 
            <p>The song perfectly blends violins into Crush 40's signature rock sound, helping to slowly build the intensity for the perfect payoff in Jun's incredible solo - and a stunning final chorus that has the violins play the main riff in the background. 
            <p>The song was actually re-recorded shortly after the game's release, with a completely different rhythm guitar tone able to be heard on "Super Sonic Songs", released later that year.</p>`,

            <p>Arguably the most iconic song in the entire Crush 40 catalogue – Live and Learn plays as the final boss theme in Sonic Adventure 2, as well as in the credits.</p>

            <p>Johnny has mentioned in interviews that he wrote the song about the experience of playing a game – having to learn to overcome any obstacle in your path in order to live.
