            <p>"Open Your Heart" is the main track of "Sonic Adventure" and the first Crush 40 track ever created - written before they even had a name!</p>
            <p>Jun made at least 7 different demos of this track before settling on the final arrangement, multiple of which were made featuring different vocalists. The earliest available demo features co-composer <i>Kenichi Tokoi</i> on vocals, and the most famous of all is the demo featuring "Anthem" vocalist <i>Eizo Sakamoto</i>, which appears to have been recorded around Summer 1998.</p>
            <p>Eizo's demo would end up making it to prototypes of the game, and was also performed the track live during the "SONIC Adventure Production Presentation" on September 1998.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this demo, Jun contacted Johnny via Neal Schon of "Journey" to ask him to record for the track, as a result completing it around October 1998 and forming their relationship that would later give rise to "Crush 40".</p>

                        <p>This song was the main theme of the game, and there were approximately 9 remakes of this song!</p>
                        <p>The backing track of this song was done quickly, but I had a very hard time coming up with the melody and lyrics (rhymes and whatnot...)</p>
                        <p>For a long time, this song didn't have a guitar solo, but I put it in at the end on a whim, and the 'whin-whin-whin' guitar sound at the end of the song is an electric screwdriver being played on the guitar, if that makes sense.</p>
                        <p>We prepared a demo of this song sung by Tokoi for the <i>Sonic Adventure Presentation</i>, and another one sung by Sakamoto that actually ended up being used.</p>
                        <p>I guess we recorded a lot of things. Recording with Johnny Gioeli in the end was tough because of our tight schedule, but it was perfect!</p>

<p>Thunder, rain, and lightning<br />
Danger, water rising<br />
Clamour, sirens wailing<br />
It's such a bad sign</p>
<p>Shadows of dark creatures<br />
Steel clouds floating in the air<br />
People run for shelter<br />
What's gonna happen to us!?</p>
<p>All the steps we take, all the moves we make, all the pain at stake<br />
I see the chaos for everyone who are we what can we do<br />
You and I are the same in the way that we have our own styles that we won't change<br />
Yours is filled with evil and mine's not there is no way I can lose</p>
<p>Can't hold on much longer - But I will never let go<br />
I know it's a one-way track - Tell me now how long this'll last<br />
I'm not gonna think this way - Nor will I count on others<br />
Close my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do</p>
<p>Open your heart, it's gonna be alright</p>
<p>Ancient city blazing<br />
Shadows keep attacking<br />
Little children crying<br />
Confusion, hopeless anger</p>
<p>I don't know what it can be but you drive me crazy<br />
All your cunning tricks make me sick, you won't have it your own way</p>
<p>Can't hold on much longer - But I will never let go<br />
I know it's a one-way track - Tell me now how long this'll last<br />
I'm not gonna think this way - Nor will I count on others<br />
Close my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do</p>
<p>Open your heart ...and you'll see...</p>
<p>If it won't stop, there will be no future for us<br />
Its heart is tied down by all the hate, gotta set him free</p>
<p>I know it's a one-way track - Tell me now how long this'll last<br />
Close my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do</p>
<p>Gotta open your heart, dude!</p>
<p>Can't hold on much longer - But I will never let go<br />
I know it's a one-way track - Tell me now how long this'll last<br />

Close my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do</p>

            <p>Like all the other songs from the game, the lyrics try to paint inspiring, liberating images in your mind - car-themed as per the game, but just vague and emotive enough to inspire you for anything.</p>
            <p>In addition to appearing in NASCAR Arcade, this song makes a surprise appearance in the credits of the DS version of Sonic And Sega All-Stars Racing! It plays after the song "So Much More" by Bentley Jones, and though it's shortened and compressed, it's certainly a welcome surprise.</p>`,

            I started from, when I believe I've won</p>
            
            <p>And as the sweat runs down my face<br />
            I put my heart into this place of mine<br />
            I go back in time, to see what I'm living in...</p>

            Life's when the race begins</p>

            Coming over me...</p>
            
            <p>Now I believe whether near or far<br />
            The road is windy there where you are you try<br />
            To take the curve, next turn another learned</p>

Looks like it came back for more - yeah yeah yeah<br />

I move an inch forward it feels like a year<br />
Everything I feel seems so unreal it's true... it's true...<br />
I'll take one step forward and two steps back<br />
Got a hundred thousand pounds sitting on my back<br />
I'm up, down, all around don't know quite what to do to get thru...</p>

Here I am, made it to the end of you<br />
Never had a chance while I'm around</p>

<p>And now I'll never turn back<br />
Never turn that way<br />
No matter how life tries to face me<br />
I'll turn the other way<br />
And now and then, my head starts to spin<br />
But I'll never turn back again<br />
From this moment on, I am moving on<br />
And I'll never turn back...</p>

<p>I guess I'm doing alright and I'm on my way<br />
Facing every moment day by day<br />
Take a chance, slip on by, got no time to answer why head straight... I head straight...<br />
And what will I become if I don't look back<br />
Give myself a reason for this and that<br />
I can learn, no u turn, gotta stay right here where I'm at... Where I'm at...</p>

You wouldn’t know it from listening to the song though – aside from the lyrics and rough vocal melody, Crush 40’s cover does not retain much of the original.</p>
		<p>Jun’s guitar part is far more complex, using a similar tone to the original mix of Knight of The Wind to great effect. There’s also more layering across the whole song, compared to the original where the clean part only appears during choruses.</p>
		<p>Perhaps due to that variety, and the addition of one of Jun’s finest guitar solos ever, the song feels dramatically shorter than the original despite only undercutting it by 20 seconds. And as always: Johnny’s vocal performance impresses, standing out as more aggressive than the original and immediately demonstrating the benefit of covering the song in a lower key.</p>`,

Myths, in mind, re-thought<br />
Question all that's known<br />
Legends blurred and torn</p>

<p>No such thing as fate for those who speed<br />
A path out of time, instead of just living it<br />
So many things erased before they begins<br />
Hopes un-dream, instead of what could have been</p>

<p>Fortune fades, like words in the sand<br />
Just like that, it nothing, it all just seems<br />
Fortune shines, with seven in hands<br />
Back to fact, make real of all that seems<br />
Make real of all that seems</p>

<p>Seven rings in hand<br />
Speed through nights with feet in sand<br />
Seven rings in hand<br />

Seven rings in hand<br />
Arrowed hearts catch fire now</p>

<p>No such thing as an arrow through who dreams<br />
Hopes may burden, but, forever, last to give in<br />
So many things need a push or pull to begin<br />
Un-free to move, unless another hand gets in</p>

<p>Be it all the same, it's never the same<br />
Just like that, just nothing, it all just means<br />
Nothing, it all just means<br />
If all as is, then it's never as is<br />

Seven rings in hand<br />

Fairy tales in trance<br />
Know what to believe<br />
Nothing is up to chance</p>

            <p>The first Crush 40 song to be played in D Standard tuning, Knight of The Wind was written as the opening track for 2009's <i>Sonic and The Black Knight</i>. The song has been a fan favourite since, with over 5 million plays on Spotify, and it's easy to see why!</p> 
            <p>The song perfectly blends violins into Crush 40's signature rock sound, helping to slowly build the intensity for the perfect payoff in Jun's incredible solo - and a stunning final chorus that has the violins play the main riff in the background. 
            <p>The song was actually re-recorded shortly after the game's release, with a completely different rhythm guitar tone able to be heard on "Super Sonic Songs", released later that year.</p>`,

            <p>While not used in Sonic and The Black Knight itself, Crush 40’s version of With Me was included on the game’s vocal tracks album, “Face to Faith”. According to Jun Senoue, it was even recorded before the version with All Ends’ vocalists that ended up being used in the final boss.</p>
            <p>It takes a darker turn than the game version – played in C Standard, 2 steps lower than its counterpart. Jun’s thicker guitar tone here also contributes to that heavier feel, using his baritone ESP VP “Shadow” for live renditions.</p>
            <p>Johnny’s lyrics encapsulate the central ideological struggle between Sonic and Merlina – to make the most of a limited life, vs existing in a hollow eternity – and his aggressive performance as compared to the All Ends version drives home that only one can come out on top. The song's climactic feel is pushed that little bit further by the chorus melody using Merlina's theme; which is heard throughout the game but now turned against the player.</p>

			<p>I wrote that song for the final boss in the Sonic and the Black Knight, and I so first I tried to find the female singers for that song. One of my friends in a Japanese record company takes care of dealings with All Ends [Tinna & Emma’s band – T], and so that’s how I got in touch with them.</p>
			<p>With Marty, although he was now living in Japan, I didn’t know him personally. I didn’t know his manager or any of the other business guys who dealt with him, so I asked him directly. Originally I planned to ask him to play all of the guitar stuff, but when he came into the studio, he said “hey, we should just keep these backing tracks!”</p>
			<p>We booked the studio here in Tokyo to record the lyrics and Marty’s guitar solo, but then the other guys came into the studio and wanted me to change the key, so I said “please give me one hour!” Since we use Pro-Tools, it was easy enough to raise the track one note, but it did not have very good clarity. We changed the key digitally anyway, then tracked the vocals, then Marty tracked his guitar. I went back later on and tracked all of the backing guitar in the correct key.</p>
                        <p>Originally my idea was to have that song in a lower key, and in fact we [Crush 40] did the demo in that much lower key, and that was featured on the Sonic and the Black Knight “Face to Faith” album and it is much heavier.</p>

Filthy separation<br />
Try and knock me down</p>
